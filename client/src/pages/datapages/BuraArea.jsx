<p>In the pre-Katrina period (before August 29, 2005) Buras had about 30-40 Cambodian shrimpers, presenting the area's large Asian American population. In the post-Hurricane period (after August 29, 2005) Brenda Kap, quoted in The New York Times, stated most of them had returned.[8] At the 2020 United States census, its Asian population was 344, making them the second-largest racial and ethnic group in the CDP; non-Hispanic and Latino whites made up 471 persons total, and Black and African Americans were the third largest group.</p>
