<h2>What Are The Main Greenhouse Gases</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gases (also known as GHGs) are gases in the earths atmosphere that trap heat.
During the day, <br/>the sun shines through the atmosphere, warming the earth’s surface. At night the earth's surface cools, releasing heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps the earth`s temperature at an average 14˚C (57˚F).
